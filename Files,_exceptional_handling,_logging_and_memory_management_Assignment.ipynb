        "### **1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "- **Interpreted languages**: Code is executed line by line by an interpreter (e.g., Python, JavaScript). There is no intermediate machine code; execution happens directly from the source code.\n",
        "- **Compiled languages**: Code is first converted into machine code or bytecode by a compiler before execution (e.g., C, C++). The machine code is then run on the machine.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **2. What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "**Exception handling** in Python refers to the process of responding to exceptions (runtime errors) using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
